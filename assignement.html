            <h2>About Tinghir</h2>
            <p>Tinghir is a town in the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco. It is the administrative center of the Tinghir 
                Province and is situated on the edge of the Sahara Desert. Here are three things that are special about Tinghir:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Todgha Gorges: <h5>One of the most spectacular natural attractions near Tinghir is the Todgha Gorges. These are a series 
                    of limestone river canyons, carved out by the Todgha River. The towering cliffs reach heights of up to 400 meters (1,312 feet), and the narrowest sections are only 10 meters (33 feet) wide. The Todgha Gorges are a popular
                     destination for rock climbers and hikers, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscapes.</h5></li>
                <li>Oasis and Agriculture: <h5>Tinghir is known for its lush green oasis, which provides a stark contrast to the arid desert surroundings. 
                    The oasis is formed by the Todgha River, and it supports a variety of agricultural activities. Date palms, fruit orchards, and various crops thrive in this fertile area. The traditional irrigation system, known as "khettaras," is still used
                     to channel water from underground sources to the fields, showcasing sustainable and ancient farming practices.</h5></li>
                <li>Historical and Cultural Heritage:<h5>Tinghir has a rich historical and cultural heritage. The old town, known as the "Tinghir Medina," features traditional Moroccan architecture with narrow alleys, adobe houses, and ancient kasbahs. The Jewish Quarter (Mellah) is another historical area that reflects Tinghir's diverse cultural past. Visitors can explore the town's historic sites, including the ruins of the Glaoui Kasbah and the old city walls, 
                    providing insights into Tinghir's past and its role as a crossroads for trade and culture.</h5></li>
            </ul>
